# Week-3-Assignment

Week 3 assignment of software development course

Project Description:
A game called cookie clicker where you click the cookie to earn cookies! Spend cookies to buy upgrades either upgrade your clicker power or buy upgrades that get cookies Automatically for you per second.

Targets i want to achieve:
Create a settings icon that when hovered over pops up a list of settings.
Make sure local storage works as i was struggling with it previously.
I want to game to load in reasonable time including saved data.
Make further upgrades appear when buying the first level of the previous upgrade.
Add achievements/messages with pop up messages like first 100 cookies! or Insufficient Cookies!
Make it responsive so any device can play.
I want to add in CSS animations.
I want to add a feature where when you click the a small cookie pops out and fades away whilst falling.

Things i struggled with:
Local storage took me a long time but once id got the hang of it and the first set up done i could add to it easily.
The functionality of showing the next upgrade when getting the previous upgrade to lvl 1.

Sources i used for help:
Youtube for CSS animations and local storage.

Things i did well:
Creating the settings container.
Appending the next upgrade when the previous one reaches lvl 1.
Adding achievements and pop up messages.
Making the game responsive.
Added random small cookies to spawn on click and use animations.
