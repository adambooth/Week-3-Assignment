# Week-3-Assignment

Week 3 assignment of software development course

Targets i want to achieve:
Create a settings icon that when hovered over pops up a list of settings.
Make sure local storage works as i was struggling with it previously.
I want to game to load in reasonable time including saved data.
Make further upgrades appear when buying the first level of the previous upgrade.
Add achievements/messages with pop up messages like first 100 cookies! or Insufficient Cookies!

Things i struggled with:
Local storage took me a long time but once id got the hang of it and the first set up done i could add to it easily.
The functionality of showing the next upgrade when getting the previous upgrade to lvl 1.
